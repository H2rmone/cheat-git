## Guide

### Change Time(macOS)

Enter your password

```sh
 sudo -s
```

Enter the time you want to return

```sh
 date {month}{day}{hour}{minute}{year}
```

For example, June 27th 1993 16:10 would become the following command:

```sh
 date 062716101993
```

### Do git things

Create a new repository and do git things as usual.
